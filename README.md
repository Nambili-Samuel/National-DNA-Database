# National DNA Database

<p>A database is a computer-based system containing biological information, or 'Bio-data,' regulated and maintained by the government or controlled by a private entity. This technology is a must-have tool in facilitating state machineries such as police, immigration, forensics, healthcare, and national security apparatus.</p>
<p>This system has scored high in countries that have already deployed DNA technology in efforts for crime prevention, analysis, monitoring, investigations, deterrence, and identification. Today, many countries worldwide are turning to DNA technologies, including our neighboring nations such as Botswana, South Africa, and Tanzania, which are planning to establish their centers.</p>
<p>DNA has become a modern forensic instrument used to resolve multiple crime convictions, exonerate wrongly accused individuals, identify missing people, settle paternalistic disputes among families, and assist medical examiners in identifying bodies that are burned or decomposed beyond recognition, as in the case of examining the remains of victims of the September 11th disaster where bodies were completely burned.</p>
<p>A national DNA database in a country can shed light on some mysterious crimes, such as those perpetrated by psychopaths like the 'B-1 Butcher,' where most traditional methods fail to produce satisfactory solutions. The advancement of national investigative technologies is a priority, as the criminal landscape is becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that special technologies like these are within our reach. DNA technology is a game-changer in criminal intelligence and solving cases that are sometimes too complex for conventional means. The system can open doors for new and wonderful medical innovations, particularly in genetic research.</p>
